## The problem

Little Sarah trying to answer one of the random questions that pop into her mind:
- Hey, sis. Why do you always cut the fish in half when putting it on the pan?
- I do it because I saw it from mom.
- Hey, mom. Why do you cut the fish in half when putting it on the pan?
- Your grandma always did this. You should ask her.
- Hey, grandma Marry. My mother and sister always cut the fish in half when they put it on the pan. They learned that from you. Why do you do it?"
- I did it because my pan was too little and the fish didn't fit in.

Young kids aren't afraid to say or ask anything. No question or statement is too foolish. When kids start growing up things start to change. Until you notice you are first grade and saying something stupid can bury/ruin your social life for a long time. This is why we just censor ourself and stop trying to go to the root of our questions.

Forward 10 years and hearing answers like "because everybody else does it like that", "because I don't feel it" or "because it's fun" starts to seem normal.

## The solution

### Ask why until you get the real reason

Be like little Sarah. Ask why multiple times. Ask it until you really understand the real reason. This seams easy but it's not. Let's see what the challenges are.

Asking why is not as simple as it sounds. Most people actually don't know the real answer and keep digging into the question can just make them angry. This happens either because they don't know what you want from them or because they have a subconscious mechanism which protects them from breaking their assumptions for the world as they have built them their entire life.

Understanding if you really have the real reason varies from easy to almost impossible. Determining if little Sarah really knows why they cut the fish in half is easy. It is so easy that even a little girl can manage that. Determining what is the reason for someone being defensive every time you try to give him constructive advice is harder. Determining why somebody doesn't want to have children with his spouse is a psychotherapy level hardness.

Proper approaches for searching the answer, knowing when to stop and understanding if you have the real reason are discussed in the _Examples_ section below.

## Learning

The most value from this approach can be gained by applying it to yourself. This is because you can learn to answer the questions you ask yourself honestly. Extracting information from other people is harder because

I don't recommend learning the method of asking why with people you can't have honest conversations with. If you don't feel you have a person you can talk with seriously I would recommend you trying n

The thing I highly recommend is to start by   Asking yourself why you do things will most often end up with biased answers and excuses.

<!-- Asking why seems easy enough but what means to get to the root answer. In reality if you try the technique you will actually have difficulties with both asking why and understanding when you have the root answer. -->

## When to do it?

- health
- relationships
- work

## Examples

What feature should we implement first?
Why do I smoke regardless of the fact it affects my health?
Why we do we get in fights with my spouse?
I feel like I am not getting what I deserve on work.
Your spouse will yell (cry or show other negative emotion) at you and you will just reply with negative emotion too (even if only in your thoughts)?
How long will you think smoking is a stress reliever.
How much more time will you spend trying to achieve.

## Conclusion

We don't actually know the answer to even the simplest questions: https://alexanderellis.github.io/blog/posts/check-valve/

I applied this thinking strategy in my life and business and I started seeing a significant difference. This is one of the most valuable lessons I have ever learned. This is the time to say thank you to [Emanuil Rusev](http://erusev.com). It wouldn't be possible to understand this concept without him.

After understanding the concept you will start seeing people who get it too. Here are videos with Steve Jobs and Elon Musk talking about the same thing:
