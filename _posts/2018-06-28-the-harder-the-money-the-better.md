The idea is that people who are given money they didn't deserve and didn't work for become shitty people. -- inherited money
People who work little and earn money are better but still have problems. -- Billions Series, fast growing startups, programmers (from zero to 1600)
People who work very hard for the money they earn make great people. -- slow growing startups, family business
