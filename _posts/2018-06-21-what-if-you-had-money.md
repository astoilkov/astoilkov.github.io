Really. Imagine you had money. Money till the end of your life. What would you do?

Yes. I am expecting answer like I am gonna have fun, rest, have sex and drugs. But let put that aside for a little. We will discuss it in the end. What if you wanted to do something constructive. What will it be? The first time I thought about this it seemed like a super easy question. However, thinking more about it it seems a really hard one.
