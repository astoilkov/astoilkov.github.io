## Bio

My name is Antonio Stoilkov. I live in [Sofia, Bulgaria](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sofia/@42.681954,23.21832,11z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x40aa8682cb317bf5:0x400a01269bf5e60!8m2!3d42.6977082!4d23.3218675). I work on a writing app called [Caret](https://caret.io/) together with my co-founder and best friend [Emanuil Rusev](http://erusev.com/). People know me as a developer but I don't find profession names good for describing people abilities so I just recognize myself as a product person. I have done everything tied to building a product from prototyping, finding product market fit and implementation to figuring out business model, marketing and hiring.

I am addicted to learning. Not facts you can google like "Which year the hundred years war ended?".

## Values

- Long Term Happiness
- Change
- Better World

- Today I should be better than yesterday self. That's the ability to change. It is very important the speed you can change.
- I want to be the best. Those who think then can't and those who think they can are both right.
- I search for long term happiness. Short term happiness is overrated. Short term happiness has it's purpose - relaxation, but not a lot more than that.
- I want to live in a better world. I want to help the world. I want to help people. I want people to grow because I understand that's the way the world grows.

I now have a balanced and fulfilling life and I know the right person is very close by.'
