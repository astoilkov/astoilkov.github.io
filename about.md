# Hello

My name is Antonio Stoilkov. I live in [Sofia, Bulgaria](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Sofia/@42.681954,23.21832,11z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x40aa8682cb317bf5:0x400a01269bf5e60!8m2!3d42.6977082!4d23.3218675).

I write about counterintuitive topics. That's what interesting to me. What all others think about is true but it actually isn't.

If you are interested in what I like and dislike head to [my recommendations page](/recommendations).

I would love if you ain't shy and send me over an email. I promise to read it and put effort to answer you politely and thoughtfully. I love to talk about [my blog posts](http://astoilkov.com), [my product](https://caret.io/) and [my open source projects](https://github.com/astoilkov?tab=repositories&type=public). I like constructive feedback. I don't like template emails - please don't do it.

I am really busy and I can't accept work offers.
